1337613998.0	45858.0	True	so, i filed for taxes yesterday and tried to claim the education tax credit and i was rejected. now i'm filing without it. i'll be getting $1545 less back. why can't you claim that education tax credit? and next year i don't want to be dependent on you. :) also, i found out that my capital one card gets 4% cash back rewards at starbucks. 3% cash back at orbitz (i found out about orbitz after i booked my flights, sadly) and $100 back when i spend $500 in the first three months (which i already have) its a pretty nice card, i told jonathan to get one.

Here are some Japanese phrases to memorize on the plane. This post is dedicated to Sarah Menkedick, who is currently learning Japanese in Nagoya, Japan. SOME OF THESE JAPANESE phrases are practical. Some of them are funny. All 10 will greatly enhance your trip to Japan. All of the phrases are pretty informal, especially the one about crapping your pants. Note that I spell the phrases phonetically in the bold text, but spell them with the most common romanization of the Japanese characters when explaining a point. Confused already? Don=92t worry about it. Keitai girl by scion02 1. =93Yo-ro-sh-ku o-neh-gai-shi-mus.=94 This phrase is absolute magic. Say =93yoroshiku=94 to any Japanese person in any situation and they will help you with anything and everything you need. It=92s impossible to translate literally, but means something to the effect of =93please do your best and treat me well=94. If you memorize nothing else before going to Japan, remember =93yoroshiku=94 and you=92re totally set. =93Onegaishimasu=94 is a common w= ord that means something similar to =93please=94. 2. =93Yosh. Gahn-bah-di-mus.=94 This phrase means something like, =93OK, I=92m going for it,=94 or =93I=92l= l do my best=94. A Japanese would say =93Ganbarimasu=94 before taking a test, or leaving the house for a job interview. Japanese people will crack up if you say it before walking outside, eating noodles or using a vending machine. Try saying it before using useful phrase # 8. 3. =93Ara! Onara suru tsu-mori datta keh-do, un-chi ga de-chatta.=94 The literal translation of this useful phrase is =93Oops! I meant to fart but poop came out=94. Saying this useful phrase never gets old, especially in public places, especially on a first date and most especially if it=92s clearly one of only 10 Japanese phrases that you=92ve memorized. When in Southeast Asia, I especially enjoy muttering in Japanese about crapping my pants while walking past Japanese tourists. The reactions are priceless. 4. =93Mo da-meh. Yoh-para-chatta. Go-men.=94 At some point during your stay, Japanese people will probably try to make you drink past your limit. That=92s when this phrase comes in handy. It means something like, =93No more, I=92m already drunk, sorry.=94 Photo by Jenny Webber 5. =93Ko-ko wa do-ko? Wa-ta-shi wa da-reh?=94 Na-ni mo wah-kah-nai.=94 Where is this? Who am I? I don=92t understand anything. This is what you say after failing to use useful phrase # 4 in time. 6. =93Ee-show ni kah-rah-o-keh ni ee-koh ka?=94 Shall we go to karaoke together? This is a good line to use if trying to pick someone up from the bar. Think of karaoke as a transition point between the bar and the love hotel. Note =96 please don=92t pronounce karaoke with lots of EEE sounds. It should sound like =93kah-rah-o-keh=94 not =93carry-oh-key=94. 7. =93Hon-toe ni oh-ee-shee des yo!=94 Use this one when eating. It means something like, =93For real, it=92s deli= cious!=94 Hontou ni means =93for real=94 or =93really=94 or =93I=92m not kidding.=94 = Japanese people are always telling sweet little white lies, so dropping a =93hontou ni=94 from time to time is very much appreciated. 8. =93Ah-nah-tah wa ha-ruh no ee-chee ban no sah-ku-rah yo-ree u-tsu-ku-she= e.=94 This classic Japanese pick-up line means =93You=92re more beautiful than the first cherry blossom of spring.=94 <>9. =93Ni-hon dai-skee=94. Japan is the best. I love Japan. When in doubt, just smile, nod and repeat. 10. =93Koh-nah ni kee-ray na to-ko-ro wa hah-jee-meh-teh mee-tah!=94 Japanese people love it when you gush about their country. This phrase means, =93I=92ve never seen a place so beautiful before=94. Bust it out at famous attractions and you=92ll meet with instant approval. Add Comment "
1338363889.0	366.0	False	 While excellent sushi can certainly be had inside of the fish market proper,= most of the eateries close around noon, and there is always a mad rush of p= atrons competing for limited seating. So we recommend eating at either one o= f the sushi restaurants in the jogai-shijo (external market) or at one of th= e fine establishments in the surrounding neighborhoods of the Tsukiji distri= ct itself. Eating at the external market, located just a block away from where the auct= ions are held, provides a slightly less hectic atmosphere. Many of the sushi= joints here are open 24 hours, and the marketplace, with its countless litt= le stores selling every type of culinary ingredient imaginable, can be a fun= side attraction. Recommendations here include Sushi Sen (Akimoto building 1F, 6-23-12 Tsukiji= , Chuo-ku, tel. 03 3549 1136) which serves naturally-caught tuna at great pr= ices, and Sushi Ichiban (4-13-15 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, tel. 03 3524 7188), which= offers a superb traditional omakase course meal for two at under =C2=A54000= . Going beyond the market The alternative is to scope out the surrounding neighborhoods of Tsukiji, wh= ere satellite establishments of those in the market provide a more refined d= ining experience in a relaxed, modern milieu. This is a great chance share t= he air with salarymen getting off of work from surrounding offices and posh s= hoppers coming down off of a Ginza high. A favorite in this area is Tama Sushi (1-9-4 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, tel. 03 3541 1= 917), which lately has been offering a 'recession special' featuring tuna an= d other delicacies at serious discounts. Sushi Iwa (2-15-12 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku= , tel.03 3541 0655) located just across the street from the external market,= would never be called inexpensive -- but don't let that be a deterrent to s= topping in and enjoying even just a few pieces of what many call the best su= shi in town. Seeing the sites A leisurely riverside stroll is certainly the perfect way to end an evening o= f seafood dining in Tokyo's sushi capital.Favorite spots in the area include= Tsukiji Honganji, a True Pure Land sect Buddhist temple known throughout th= e city for its Indian-inspired stone architecture, and the Kachidoki Bridge,= a lovely short span (illuminated blue and green at night) that connects Tsu= kiji with the man-made islands on the other side of the Sumida River.

1338814717.0	49039.0	True	Hey dad, I'm loving bejing. I found some ray bans at a market the other day, but the people were very difficult to negotiate with and the quality of the ray bans was nowhere near as good as in hong kong. im going to visit a different market tomorrow and see what i can find. I did buy 20 before leaving Hong Kong for 55 HKD each. i dont think i will be able to fit 200 ray bans in my suitcase though so i might ship it to your address. My suitcase is a bit full. Anyways, my flight back to the US leaves the day after tomorrow. Also, a friend asked me if you know the owners of Lincoln Hall in Chicago. Talk to you soon! Nelson 
1338898206.0	52905.0	True	I found some really good fakes here in Beijing but also a bit pricey. They were 100rmb if I bought 100. ($16.5 each) They were heavy (made of metal and glass) and they weren't painted on like the Hong Kong ones. But when I went to withdraw money, the atm only let me withdraw 3000rmb and they wouldn't give me the same price for only 40. It costs me $5 to withdraw money here so I only got one for myself with a prescription. It cost 300rmb for the high quality ray bans with prescription lenses about $48. Anyways, this market was fantastic and i wish I had more time but they closed at 7pm and I leave tomorrow. They had some Georgio Armani leather bags that I swear were stolen from the factory. I also bought a little box of 10 cohiba minis for 50rmb ($8). I'll be back in the us tomorrow so ill call you with a real phone. Nelson

If succesfully called, this method will return a `User` JSON object representing the user that just logged in. If the given username and password are invalid an HTTP 401 response will be returned with the `WWW-Authenitcate` header set to the value `password`. This method must be called before any other method can be called. If either `username` or `password` are not provided, or they are empty strings, an HTTP 400 response will be returned ## [GET] /restapi/restaurants/latitude/longitude/{?radius=search_radius&max_results=max_search_results} Based on the latitude and longitude parameters, this method returns a JSON Array of nearby Restaurant Location JSON Objects which are sorted by their distance from the given location. If no nearby restauruants are found an empty JSON array will be returned. An optional `radius` parameter may be specified, thus indicating the desired search radius for the query. The radius should be specified in kilometers. If no radius is specified, the server will fallback to it's own desired default. An optional `max_results` parameter may be specified, thus indicating the desired maximum results for the server to return. If the server finds the specified radius unaccepatable (i.e. it's too big or too small), an HTTP 406 response will be returned with the header `X-Not-Acceptable-Reason` set to `Bad Radius`. The response will also contain a JSON object indicating the range (in dijkstra notation) of acceptable radii. The JSON object will have the following form: { ""min_radius"" : Minimum search radius in kilometers (inclusive), ""max_radius"" : Maximum search radius in kilometers (exclusive) } "

1341000057.0	71203.0	True	Hey guys, Ive got some questions so sorry for the long email! lol...So first, we have all of these restaurants in the database and they don't have locations just yet. I was just wondering why is it that they need locations to be on the app or is that just like the beta version? I put in a location for one of the Mcdonalds, so does that mean it will show up on the app next time? When we add more restaurants and stuff do they go directly onto the app say when were live or is that something that say I add 10 new restaurants, we have to do an update and then thats when they show up? Also for the app is there going to be like a tutorial to show the customer how to use the app? Also on the part where they create an account, there needs to be the part where they can check off the allergies that there allergic too and more importantly there needs to be a box where they check for the terms and agreements so that we can protect ourselves. Also, this is great for a soft launch so that I can actually pitch it now to people, but I'm not going to want to launch it until we have the full app ready to go (with the other buttons and stuff) How long do you guys think until we can get that done? Everything else is looking great and if I think of anymore questions Ill let you guys know!

1341000057.0	79069.0	True	"Locations are necessary because thats how the backend knows which = restaurants to return. So when you update the location or add an = location on the backend, it will automatically send the correct data to = the app. No app update needed. There will be no tutorial on how to use the app. If one is needed, then = the app is designed wrong. In the mobile field, there should be no need for a tutorial, especially for an app as = simple as this. If I add all the allergies the on one screen for registration it will be = very clogged and hard to use. A user can remove/add allergies from the myAllergies tab. I think registration = should be super simple, and the ability to customize an account comes later. As far a deadline, I am still under the impression that my job ""ends"" = July 15th. I will have everything ready on my side at that time, and will send you the app and code that day as = well.

1341000057.0	79841.0	True	Henry, While a lot of the back end features are near finished, what you are actually seeing and interacting with on the app is about 20% done. There is still a tone of work left to do to make it a great user experience, both in the designs and in adding the functionality. Robert has a few more things to do and then him and I are going to meet to tighten up all the designs. The will likely be after next week, so we'd probably submit the first version to the app store on july 15 or so and it will be out in about a week. >From there, Robert will have updates which will take another week or so and then it should be usable for customers.

1341000057.0	82581.0	True	I disagree with Adam about the 20%. The only functionality not yet = implemented=20 is QR scan, and one remove/add allergy bug remains. Everything else = works and is there. Also, I aim to be done by July 15th. That is the deadline I was given at = the beginning of the project. I will finish functionality side (QR and fix the bug) in = the next few days. Then Adam an I will tighten the designs, and you have a few days to play = and test the app. Ill fix any bugs that remain.=20 (So Adam, when do you want to meet?) Also, as far as app store submission, my account is tied to my business. = Henry will need to get his own account to host Eatible. This is better for many reasons = (separation of apps,=20 he can view the downloads without needing to email me, he can update app = info, ect).=20 I'll be happy to put the first version up for him.=20 After July 15th Ill have to focus on a different project I am working = on, for a Psych professor at U of I.

1342536215.0	1870.0	True	"Hi Nelson, No worries, I look forward to working with you! I just wasn't sure what was going on with the android app, I'm looking to launch around August and I just wanted to see how things were going? I know for apple that you have to submit it and then also pay $100 a year for it, is that the same for Android? Can you help me to sign up with Android so it can be under my name? Also, I've talked with Robert and Kurtis about the coding. Pretty much I'm just going to need you to sign a contract pretty much just saying that I own the work...as Robert explained to me, the code that you write for it you might have used in other apps or will use so you can still use that, but pretty much you can't use the code to make another allergy app etc. let me know what you think? Also, is there a way I can download a beta version before we release it? I have the apple one right now and Robert is using test flight. My number is 847-337-0193, feel free to give me a call anytime!

1344266876.0	31743.0	True	Hey, The main screen just adds another click that the user need in order to get to what he wants. If the user wants to see a list of nearby restaurants, then it is 0 clicks (just the login). But if he wants to do a QR scan then it will be 1 click. However, I thought we removed the QR functionality since I haven't received any info about how it works with the API. If we add a main screen, then it is 1 click to get to nearby restaurants and 1 click to do a QR scan. Anyways, I fixed the registration, and added some more features. As for the layouts, yes I got the PDFs. I don't have the app icon that its supposed to be. The layouts aren't done yet, but the one's in the PDFs are very iOS so I will end up taking the design feel of the app and make it more comfortable for an android user. And yes, I do realize that I'm quite late on this app at this point and I apologize for that.

1353690117.0	3827.0	False	Lee!!! are you going monday? Make sure you know linked lists: traversal, deletions, addition Tree traversal, in order, pre order, post order. depth first search, breadth first search HASHMAPS! recursion! Ask clarifying questions, sometimes they don't tell you everything about a problem so you have to ask them for more details. Get a naive solution before you go on to a faster one or at least explain to them the naive solution. relax. Remember to discuss your solution as you think of it or code it. It's probably better to talk to much than too little. Almost all of their questions are going to be very standard (straight out of cracking the coding interview) so read that or check online for common interview questions. I can give you some if you need. And then you will probably get one question that is a bit harder just talk a lot and theyll usually give you hints. Anyways, good luck! I hope you get it!

1380403096.0	119442.0	False	Oh I see. I tried enabling the app for the Huawei U8180 in my play store developer console but google won't allow me. I believe it is because I did not create assets for small screen devices. It should, however still work perfectly on these devices. You are welcome to pull the app from one phone and install it on another. If you have adb installed on your computer you can just plug your phone in and type. adb pull /data/app/com.nelson.gpsenable then plug in the other phone and type adb install com.nelson.gpsenable the instructions vary by phone.

1384381778.0	20859.0	False	Hey, My background includes making a lot of android apps. Last summer I interned at Facebook where I worked on the Messenger for Android team. We worked on the 3.0 release. My intern projects included the new settings screen, expandable notifications, and the chat head inbox jewel. I'm looking to work on an Android app on a small team. I really love working with smart motivated people.

1384909982.0	1667.0	True	Hi, I'm in 1012 W clark apt 21. My toilet has recently started making a small trickle noise that stays for hours after I flush. I fear it is wasting water. What can I do about this? Cheers, Nelson 
1383093725.0	1874231.0	False	"Hey Nelson, Without further ado, here's our Android challenge. Let me know if you have any questions. Eliot Android Developer Challenge Design and implement a live wallpaper<http://android-developers.blogspot.de/2010/02/live-wallpapers.htm= l > for Android devices (2.1+). The goal is to display a waveform on the Android home screen, using data from the Soundcloud API <http://developers.soundcloud.com/>. Specification: The user installs the app on her phone. A new Live wallpaper is selectable. Once the user selects this wallpaper a (random) waveform is downloaded in the background and displayed on the user's home screen. The user can open the url of the track by interacting with the background. The wall paper should change automatically after a while, to another random track/waveform= . Requirements: - Android 2.1+ compatible. - Don't unnecessarily drain battery. - Make sure network settings are honoured. - Use the SoundCloud API to obtain the PNG with the waveform<http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference#tracks> (example <http://waveforms.soundcloud.com/KFe8oPQ1jmBR_m.png>). It could be a random waveform (maybe from the tracks of a specified user (/users/:name/tracks.{json,xml}), or from someones favourite tracks (/users/:name/favorites.{json,xml})), it does not matter. - The displayed waveforms should change from time to time (for example every hour, or after some user interaction). - The waveform should look nice, so some form of post-processing is probably needed. It should also fit the screen. Optional: the user should be able to interact with the screen background (e.g. double tapping), to open a browser with the corresponding track url. Optional: display the name of the track on the home screen. Any language which works on Android can be used.
